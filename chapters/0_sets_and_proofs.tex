\chapter{Sets and Proofs}

\section{Sets and set operations}

We will begin by exploring the concept of a set through what is sometimes called intuitive or naive set theory. A more rigorous approach, axiomatic set theory, is outside the scope of this course. For the purposes of this course, our intuitive treatment of sets will suffice.

\begin{defn}
A \defnem{set} is a well-defined collection of objects.
\end{defn}
